## Overview

Budget Tracker emables users to add expenses and deposits to their budget. They can do so both with a network connection and without one. If, the users enters transactions while there is no network connection that data will populate the budget total when the network is available.

Budget Tracker is a PWA. What does that mean for the Buget Tracker App? It is installable- users can interact with Budget Tracker as if it was a native app on their device. It can load without any network connecton and sync updates without interferring with the user's experience on the front-end of the application.
